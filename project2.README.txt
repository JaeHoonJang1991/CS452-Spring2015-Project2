Well the original plan for this project was moving Pac-man with 3 different viewpoints.

Later we change our plan with new one, since we can use three.js files. 

Now we can change viewpoint by click and drag.
we build the cube and 15 balls in the cube.
There is physics algorithm in the program.

Update function is physics algorithm:
if ball reached the end of box, it gets bouncing back. 
depending on the ball's mass after bouncing each other, the two ball has new direction and speed.

==============error in program==============
there are some error in the graphic.
some of the balls are started outside or at the box.
These balls are moving in 2D not 3D in the plane.
Sometime ball are got out from this error with some bouncing.
Most of times it slowly pushed outside of cube.
we try to put the shadow for balls.
However, the balls' shadow only show in bottom plane.
not on side.
this isn't error but unexpected environment texture applied to the ball.
there is only one light source in program.
you would see the very bright white spot on ball is specular light from light.
you also see the very bright colour spot on ball is specular light from wall.
In addition, when the ball is near to the wall you can see the change of surface of ball.
only thing we can explain is the ball has environment texture is applied, so the reflection of wall is on the ball.  

============== control in program ===============
There isn't any interaction for program. 
only system that can be control by user is viewpoint.
Click and drag.

be sure to include complete details of how to interact with your application
